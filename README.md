I built a neural network to recognize handwritten digits that achieved a *96% test accuracy*. Here's what I learned:
   
**1. Neural Network basics:** Learned how to set up the NN architecture (hidden layers, ReLU activation, Adam optimizer) and why each piece matters for getting good results.   
   
**2. Training v. Testing Data:** Figured out why you need separate training and testing data - to ensure the model really works (and not just memorized the answers).   
   
**3. End-to-End ML Implementation** - the process of loading data → training a model → checking results → visualizing predictions.
