**key takeaways:** 
The goal of this project was to create a neural network that identifies handwritten digits. I learned:

+ Neural network architecture: Understanding how to design and configure a Multi-Layer Perceptron with hidden layers, activation functions (ReLU), and optimization algorithms (Adam) to solve classification problems.  
+ Model evaluation best practices: Learning the importance of splitting data into training and testing sets to properly assess model performance and avoid overfitting, while interpreting metrics like accuracy and precision.  
+ End-to-end ML workflow: data loading and preprocessing -> model training -> evaluation -> visualization and interpretation of results.
